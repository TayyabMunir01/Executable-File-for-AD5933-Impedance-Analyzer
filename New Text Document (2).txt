connect the arduino to the AD5933 like this

1. 3.3V (Arduino) -->  +3.3V (AD5933)
2. Gnd (Arduino) -->  GND (AD5933)
3. A4 (Arduino --> SDA (AD5933)
4. A5 (Arduino) --> SCL (AD5933)

the unknown impedacne is connected between these terminals



download all the files on your computer and extract them.



open arduino file and select arduino board and arduino Port


put and unknown impedance between terminals of the device

open software and select the parameters
